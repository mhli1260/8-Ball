Description: My project is a virtual version of pool. This game incorporates collision, friction, and the power of the hit from the cue stick. There is a two player game option where the players take turns trying to get their assigned ball type (either stripes or solid) into one of the six sockets. The player to get all their assigned balls, AND the black 8 ball first will be the winner of the game. There is also a single player version, where the goal of the game is to get every single ball, except the cue ball, into a socket before time runs out.
